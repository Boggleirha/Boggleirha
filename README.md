Hi, I'm Irha! I'm a queer woman (she/her) whose age matches the year (if it's 2025, I'm 25), and I'm in the US (EST time zone). 
You can find me on AO3, Character AI, DeviantArt, Facebook, Fandom Wiki, Fictionpress, GitHub, Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Wattpad, Pixiv (18+) all under the same name: Boggleirha. 
And my fanfiction alt account: Irhaboggle. 
I write mainly lesbian and queer fantasy/sci-fi romance, and I'm getting into 3D art as well.
I'm a recent college grad currently working as a counselor with a Masters in social work. I've been writing since 2015, posting since 2018.
Lastland is my first creation, starring Iris Long and her girlfriend Storm, who are also at the heart of my "Thieves in the Night" twine game (view repository).
Sleeping Citadel is my next creation, starring Sonorhc the Necromancer, Reaper the Destructionist, and Nevermore the Shadow-Traveler, who are also at the heart of my dating sim twine game (view repository).
